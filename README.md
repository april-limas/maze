Development Plan: 

1. Create maze
    a. Create a function to create a maze using the provide map array.
    b. Use nested loops inside the function to create row divs and column divs for every iteration

2. Player div should be able to move around the maze using arrow keys.
    a. Create a keydown event listener to move the player div around the maze.
    b. Create a condition so the player div can't move through walls

3. Create a winning condition
    a. The game is over when the player div has the same position as the finish div.
